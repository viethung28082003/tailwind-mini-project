            <p class="text-purple-300 z-10">" I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and mostly grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

            <p class="text-gray-400 z-10">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
